This game is almost as same as cricket but you will play against the computer and you and computer will have only one wicket.
First you have to choose for the toss(Heads or Tails) against the computer.
If you get Heads you win the toss and you choose to bowl or bat.
If you get Tails you lose the toss and computer chooses to bowl or bat.
Now for playing you have to choose a number between 0 to 10 and enter in the input section. The computer also does the same.This process is repeated until you are not out(if you are batting) or until you take a wicket(if you are bowling).
If the number you entered is not same as the number which the computer chooses, then it will be added to your total score(If you are batting and computer is bowling) and to the    computer's score( If you are bowling and computer is batting).
If the number you entered is same as the number which the computer chooses, then you will be out(If you are batting) or you then took the computer’s wicket(if you are bowling).
The total score will be the sum of all numbers you entered until you are out(If you are batting) or until you take the wicket(If you are bowling).
If you have more total score than the computer you win , else the computer wins.
